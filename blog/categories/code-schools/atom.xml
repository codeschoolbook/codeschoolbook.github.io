    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.coursereport.com/">Course Report</a> is an awesome resource for anyone thinking of attending a coding bootcamp. It is an impartial site where you can find honest student reviews and resources for every stage of your journey. They have just published the results of their <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/2015-coding-bootcamp-job-placement-demographics-report">second annual Graduate Survey</a>, and the numbers paint a glowing picture for prospective students.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert! In the end, most students are very happy with their decision to go to code school, with reported satisfaction ratings up to 8.42/10 from 8.1/10.<!--more--></p>

<p>There were fewer qualifying code schools represented in the survey this year (44 down from 48), but more students met inclusion criteria (665 up from 432). The biggest win for this survey is the breakdown of outcomes by post-bootcamp time-to-employment.</p>

<ul>
<li>27% of students were employed at a job requiring the skills they learned at bootcamp within 30 days after graduation</li>
<li>61% were placed after 60 days</li>
<li>79% within 90 days</li>
<li>88% within 120 days</li>
</ul>


<p>These numbers mean that developer jobs are being filled by code school grads at a sustained rate. The code school model of learning web development in a bootcamp-style environment is gaining momentum, and does not show signs of slowing down. While most of the students who opt for code school are getting hired, it&rsquo;s important to note that the employment process takes time and that jobs aren&rsquo;t available to everyone right out of the gate. Be prepared for two or more months of continued unemployment after your program has completed.</p>

<p>Also, you may have to work a little harder to get your foot in the door, as fewer schools (53% down from 60%) offered opportunities for internships with employer partners, or on-site interviews.</p>

<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, tuition is rising, up from an average of $10,267 in 2014 to $11,852 this year. With newly available student loans from external lending partners, 25% of graduates were able to finance their tuition, compared to 4% the year before. Student age is also going up (last year: 29, this year: 31).</p>

<h4>What does this mean for code school students?</h4>

<p>There has never been a better time to learn web development. Code school is starting to fill the skills gap that left so many developer positions empty. The jobs are waiting, and the financial backing is there to help you succeed.</p>
