  <div class="entry-content"><p>I didn&rsquo;t get into code school the first time I applied. I set my sights on a program but didn&rsquo;t make the first cut. Even though I had some programming experience, my application did not stand out enough to score me an interview. I was disappointed, but took advantage of the opportunity to firm up my financial footing and beef up my application. If your heart is set on a particular school, city, and program, don&rsquo;t be discouraged if you don&rsquo;t get in the first time you apply.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many code schools are interested in your profile as it appears on paper: a resume, cover letter, and your online presence (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc). These schools will make their decision based on an in-person (or Skype) interview, where they can get a feel for why you are choosing code school, what drives you, and how well you will interview for your first job in tech. Others will ask you for a small, creative project to set yourself apart from the other candidates.</p>

<p>Many people have asked me what it is like on the other side of code school, and if there is any advice I would give to someone before they get their first programming job. Technical ability, problem solving, and communication skills are all essential to success as a developer, and your online presence is a way to demonstrate all three. Getting your foot in the door requires having something to show — keeping your foot in the door requires a little bit more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my book I advise students to prepare for a minimum of two months of additional unemployment after they graduate from a full-time code school. Why so much time? Won&#8217;t there be employers clamoring to hire you, now that you have mad programming skillz? While you may be anxiously awaiting a response to your application, there are a few important things to remember while you wait.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going to code school was a hard decision to make, and I made it with surprisingly little information. I had been learning how to write code for a few years, but developing scripts to handle repetitive work is different from building software. I didn&#8217;t know anyone in the industry, or how to break in. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All I really knew was that I enjoyed the challenge of writing code. That is when I heard about code school.</span></p>

<p>Learning to program at a code school is a great opportunity to acquire new skills, and to make your current skills relevant in tech. Becoming a software developer is the most common goal, but there is a wide variety of roles that technical people can play in software that aren’t about writing code. Whether you have left a job in customer service, teaching, or research, the skills you gained in your last career will help you fill a niche in your new one. Here are a few paths in tech that don’t involve writing software, but do require some experience with coding, frameworks, and methodologies.</p>
